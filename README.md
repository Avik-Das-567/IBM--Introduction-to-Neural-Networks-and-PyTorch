## Detailed Overview
**Step 1 :** Data Loading and Preprocessing

**Task 1 :** Load the League of Legends dataset and preprocess it for training.

- This step involves reading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features. You will prepare the data for model training utilizing pandas for data manipulation, train_test_split from sklearn for data splitting, and StandardScaler for feature scaling. The data is then converted into PyTorch tensors, which are essential for PyTorch-based model training.

**Step 2 :** Logistic Regression Model

**Task 2 :** Implement a logistic regression model using PyTorch.

- Here, you will define the logistic regression model by specifying the input dimensions and the forward pass using the sigmoid activation function. You will set the stage for training the logistic regression model by initializing the model, loss function, and optimizer.

**Step 3 :** Model Training

**Task 3 :** Train the logistic regression model on the dataset.

- The training loop will run for a specified number of epochs. In each epoch, the model makes predictions, calculates the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the model parameters. This iterative process helps in optimizing the model to accurately predict match outcomes.

**Step 4 :** Model Optimization and Evaluation

**Task 4 :** Implement optimization techniques and evaluate the model's performance.

- Optimization techniques such as L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) help in preventing overfitting. The model is retrained with these optimizations, and its performance is evaluated on both training and testing sets to ensure robustness.

**Step 5 :** Visualization and Interpretation

**Task 5 :** Visualize the model's performance and interpret the results.

- Visualization tools like confusion matrices and ROC curves provide insights into the model's performance. The confusion matrix helps in understanding the classification accuracy, while the ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

**Step 6 :** Model Saving and Loading

**Task 6 :** Save and load the trained model.

- This task demonstrates the techniques to persist a trained model using **`torch.save`** and reload it using **`torch.load`**. Evaluating the loaded model ensures that it retains its performance, making it practical for deployment in real-world applications.

**Step 7 :** Hyperparameter Tuning

**Task 7 :** Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best learning rate.

- By testing different learning rates, you will identify the optimal rate that provides the best test accuracy. This fine-tuning is crucial for enhancing model performance.

**Step 8 :** Feature Importance

**Task 8 :** Evaluate feature importance to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.

- Understanding feature importance helps in identifying which in-game statistics are most influential in predicting match outcomes. This step involves extracting the weights of the linear layer and visualizing them.
